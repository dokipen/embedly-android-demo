Embedly Android Demo App
------------------------

The Embedly Android Demo App provides a reference implementation of the
Embedly Pro endpoints for Android development.  To get it working, you will
need to update src/com/embedly/android/demo/Demo.java with your Embedly Pro
key.  We have provided EmbedlyDemo.apk with a working key if you'd like
to try the app.  It is also available `here <http://static.embed.ly/apks/EmbedlyDemo.apk>`_.

Also included in the source is libs/embedly-api-0.1.0.jar.  When writing
your own app, check https://github.com/embedly/embedly-java for a the latest
official embedly-api jar file.

Prerequisites
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Eclipse (I'm using Classic 3.6.2)
* Android SDK (I'm using api level 8)
* The ADT Plugin (I'm using 10.0.1v20110311)

Note on Patches/Pull Requests
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
